# Data Structures in Java

Welcome to the "Data Structures in Java" repository! This collection includes Java implementations of fundamental data structures.This repository showcases Java implementations of classic data structures. 

Explore the following implemented data structures:

1. **LinkedList**
   - **Description:** A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next one.
   - **Usage:** Efficient for insertions and deletions. Can be used to implement dynamic data structures like stacks and queues.

2. **Stack**
   - **Description:** Follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
   - **Usage:** Ideal for managing function calls, parsing expressions, undo mechanisms, etc.

3. **Queue**
   - **Description:** Follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
   - **Usage:** Useful in scenarios like breadth-first search algorithms, managing tasks in a printer queue, etc.

4. **Array**
   - **Description:** A fixed-size, ordered collection of elements.
   - **Usage:** Provides constant-time access to elements using an index. Suitable for scenarios where the size is known in advance.

5. **BinaryTree**
   - **Description:** A hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children.
   - **Usage:** Commonly used in search algorithms and forming the basis for more complex structures like Binary Search Trees.

6. **HashMap**
   - **Description:** A collection of key-value pairs with constant-time average complexity for basic operations.
   - **Usage:** Efficient for lookups and retrievals. Used in various algorithms and applications for fast data access.
